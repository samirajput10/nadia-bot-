# **App Name**: G-Bot

## Core Features:

- Chat Interface: Provide a simple text input area and display area for conversation.
- Response Logic: Automatically respond with the single character 'G' regardless of the input. This will involve using an LLM as a 'tool', where the LLM decides whether to use some provided information ('the user said this') to construct a relevant or correct response, but always replies with 'G'.
- User Message Display: Display the user's messages alongside the bot's response.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#89CFF0) to create a friendly and approachable feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EAF4F8), near-white to provide a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A slightly darker blue (#60A3D4) for interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern look for both headings and body.
- Simple, outlined icons to represent chat actions (e.g., send, clear).
- Clean and minimal layout with clear separation of user messages and bot responses.
- Subtle fade-in animations for new messages.
